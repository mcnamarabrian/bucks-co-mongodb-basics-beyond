Bucks County DevOps Meetup
==========================

# Overview

This repository contains files referenced during the January 2014 Bucks County DevOps Meetup [MongoDB - The Basics and Slightly Beyond](http://www.meetup.com/Bucks-County-DevOps/events/153800082/).

## Vagrant

I have used [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) to create virtual standalone instances as well as a 3-member replica set.

## Scripts

I have created some Python scripts that use the PyMongo driver to interact with the Mongo replica set.
